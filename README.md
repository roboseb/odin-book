    Did a lot of brainstorming for this one, and I think I came up with a reasonably doable project that is at least a little interesting. 

    Basically, a social game type deal, where the game is similar to the dice game in Kingdom Come, Deliverance. In that game, you can find lots of different types of cheat dice that are weighted in all sorts of interesting ways. Depending on how much time I want to put into it, I will either just remake that idea, or add to it a simple card mechanic that changes your goal in dice rolls.

    Also, feels good coming back to a single project setup. Although my mind is slightly scrambled having only barely learned some of this stuff, and then coming back to Pug and friends after dealing with React for the past week.
